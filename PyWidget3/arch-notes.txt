you should make a canvas (or other container) to contain all other widgets.
this common container will provide routing for text handling and for draw order.

base class:
    widget.py

container classes:
    vbox
    hbox
    dialog
    canvas

widgets can have a parent.

the container classes set the parent for the elements when the container is
constructed

elements (child windows) are drawn in the order they are created.
items created last are on top.

elements are stored in an OrderedDict to preserve/create a defined order
and so elements can be accessed by key.

combobox and dialog items bring themselves to the foreground,
they need to do that, because they can overlap other controls.
they need access to notify their parent.

A widget's parent is set by the parent when the element is added.



if windows could overlap, they must be contained in a common ancestor window,
even if that parent window draws nothing it will coordinate the draw and message
handling

if multiple editbox widgets exist, they must have a common ancestor.
this is required to route text/caret events to the correctly.

any container widget can act as the topmost window.
